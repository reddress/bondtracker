Because prices change daily, using a double-entry accounting system is
prone to errors and confusion.

First, Bonds (which belong to a BondType) are defined.

An Investor wraps an User with a single currency symbol.

An Investor has many Brokers. Accounts outside bond investments may be
grouped into an "External" Broker.

FundsTransfers move balances between Brokers.

A TransactionType merely wraps +/-1, to increase or lower the balance
of the Broker that handled the transaction.

FundsTransfers and Transactions must not be done in the admin, because
they affect the Brokers' balances.
